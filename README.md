## 🔥 General Rules to Rock by 🎧

- **Creativity FTW!** 💡: Rules are meant to be *bent*, *twisted*, and *morphed*. Go wild! If you've got something out of the box 🛸, break the rules, and we might still merge it. (Yeah, we’re cool like that 😎).
  
- **💾 Protect the Sacred Code:** Thou shalt *not delete* any existing content. Add your flair without erasing history. 🔐

- **🌀 Code Style? Do YOU:** Whether your code is a spotless masterpiece 🎨 or a chaotic explosion 🌪️ of genius, as long as it works, it works! No judgment here. 😏

- **👩‍💻 Add Your Name to the Hall of Fame:** Don’t forget to sign your work ✍️. Drop your name in the `contributorsList` file. Leave your mark!

- **Tiny but Mighty PRs 🧚‍♀️:** Small pull requests = 💨 faster merges. Minimize conflicts and make life easier for everyone. Let’s keep it swift!
